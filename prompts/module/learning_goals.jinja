# YOUR TASK

Generate **3–5 learning goals**. For each goal, also provide:

- **takeaways**: What the student should understand or retain (key concepts, ideas, facts).
- **competencies**: What the student should be able to *do* that demonstrates mastery (observable skills or abilities).

### Requirements:

* Each goal description should begin with a **strong action verb** (e.g., *Explain, Apply, Analyze, Compare, Design, Evaluate*)
* Goals must be **directly grounded in the module's content**
* Be **achievable within a single module or chapter**
* Takeaways should be 1–3 bullet points summarizing the key knowledge
* Competencies should be 1–3 bullet points describing demonstrable skills
* If **no materials are provided**, infer reasonable goals from the module name and description

# OUTPUT FORMAT

Output a **valid JSON array** and nothing else. No markdown fences, no explanation.

Example format:
[
  {
    "description": "Analyze the trade-offs between different sorting algorithms",
    "takeaways": "- Time and space complexity of comparison-based sorts\n- When to prefer one algorithm over another\n- Stability and in-place properties",
    "competencies": "- Compare algorithm performance on different input distributions\n- Select an appropriate sorting strategy for a given constraint set"
  }
]
